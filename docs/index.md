Welcome to the official documentation for Agent Zero, a personal and organic AI agentic framework.  Agent Zero is designed to be dynamic, organically growing, and learning as you use it. This framework empowers you to create autonomous agents that can perform tasks, learn from experience, and adapt to new situations.  Unlike traditional agentic systems, Agent Zero is highly transparent, customizable, and allows for direct user interaction, offering a unique and powerful approach to AI agent development.

## Key Features

* **Dynamic and Organic:** Agent Zero evolves as you use it, learning from past interactions and adapting its behavior accordingly.  This organic growth allows the system to become increasingly effective over time.
* **Transparent and Customizable:** The framework is open and accessible, allowing you to understand its inner workings and customize it to your specific needs. Modify agent behavior, create new tools, and tailor the system to fit your unique use cases.
* **Computer as a Tool:** Agents utilize the full power of your operating system. They can execute commands, run scripts, access files, and interact with other software, effectively using the computer as a comprehensive toolset.
* **Multi-Agent Cooperation:** Create hierarchies of agents, where superior agents delegate tasks to subordinates, enabling efficient breakdown of complex problems and collaborative problem-solving.
* **Persistent Memory:** Agents retain knowledge from previous conversations and tasks, allowing them to learn from experience and avoid repeating mistakes. This memory persists across sessions, enabling continuous improvement.
* **Interactive Terminal Interface:** Observe agent activity in real-time through a colorful and interactive terminal output. Intervene at any point to guide agents, provide instructions, or correct errors.
* **Web UI:** A user-friendly web interface provides a convenient alternative for interacting with your agents, streamlining communication and task management.  *(See videos above!)*
